or Common Admission Test are widely popular among the business schools for giving admission to their programmes including the top business schools and IIMs as well. There is one major difference between GMAT and CAT Exam is that GMAT entrance test is accepted by business schools across the world while CAT is majorly popular amongst business schools in India. GMAT scores are also accepted by many top business schools in India as well. GMAT is usually given by students who wish to pursue business or management course abroad. The IIMs accept the GMAT score of Indian domestic candidates for their executive management programmes. Also, there is a huge difference between the costs of both the entrance tests. The GMAT costs $250, whereas, the CAT Exam costs Rs. 1100. So, CAT Exam is relatively cheaper than GMAT.</p></div></div>"
